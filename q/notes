Certainly! Here's an updated version where the chat bot fills in the placeholders after reading the writing:

"Please format the JSON to match the following structure:

Add the quiz information for the specific quiz:
'quizCode': [quiz_code_placeholder]
'quizName': [quiz_name_placeholder]
'numberOfQuestions': [number_of_questions_placeholder]
Include the 'questions' array with the respective question objects, each containing:
'question': The question text
'options': The array of options
'difficulty': The difficulty level of the question (to be added for each question)
Ensure that the JSON structure is properly nested and formatted."
After reading the writing, the chat bot will fill in the placeholders with the appropriate values. For example:

[quiz_code_placeholder] might be replaced with "QZ001"
[quiz_name_placeholder] might be replaced with "Construction and Architecture Quiz"
[number_of_questions_placeholder] might be replaced with 13
