      "difficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between compound and isolation exercises?",
      "options": ["Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups, while isolation exercises work only one", "Isolation exercises are performed with heavy weights, while compound exercises are performed with lighter weights", "Compound exercises are more effective for fat loss, while isolation exercises are more effective for muscle gain", "Isolation exercises are performed with machines, while compound exercises are performed with free weights"],
      "answer": "Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups, while isolation exercises work only one",
      "explanation": "Compound exercises, such as squats and deadlifts, work multiple muscle groups at once, while isolation exercises, such as bicep curls and leg extensions, focus on a single muscle group.",
      "questionNumber": 6,
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the proper breathing technique when strength training?",
      "options": ["Hold your breath", "Breathe in during the eccentric phase, breathe out during the concentric phase", "Breathe out during the eccentric phase, breathe in during the concentric phase", "Breathe in and out rapidly throughout the exercise"],
      "answer": "Breathe out during the eccentric phase, breathe in during the concentric phase",
      "explanation": "When strength training, it is important to breathe out during the eccentric, or lowering, phase of the exercise, and breathe in during the concentric, or lifting, phase. This can help prevent injury and increase muscle activation.",
      "questionNumber": 7,
      "difficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between compound exercises and isolation exercises?",
      "options": ["Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at the same time, while isolation exercises focus on a single muscle group.", "Compound exercises are only performed with free weights, while isolation exercises are only performed on machines.", "Compound exercises are for strength training, while isolation exercises are for endurance training.", "There is no difference."],
      "answer": "Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at the same time, while isolation exercises focus on a single muscle group.",
      "explanation": "Compound exercises, such as squats and bench presses, involve multiple joints and muscle groups working together to perform the movement. Isolation exercises, such as bicep curls and leg extensions, focus on a single joint and muscle group to perform the movement.",
      "questionNumber": 8,
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of progressive overload in strength training?",
      "options": ["To reduce the risk of injury", "To decrease muscle mass", "To increase muscle size and strength", "To decrease flexibility"],
      "answer": "To increase muscle size and strength",
      "explanation": "Progressive overload is the gradual increase of stress placed upon the body during exercise. This increase in stress stimulates the muscles to adapt and grow, resulting in increased muscle size and strength over time.",
      "questionNumber": 9,
      "difficulty": "Easy"

      "answer": "Exhale during the eccentric phase, inhale during the concentric phase",
      "explanation": "The eccentric phase of a strength training exercise is when the muscle is lengthening, while the concentric phase is when the muscle is contracting. Exhaling during the eccentric phase and inhaling during the concentric phase can help to maintain proper form and provide a steady flow of oxygen to the muscles.",
