      "question": "Cross-contamination occurs when bacteria from one food item is transferred to another food item.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "Cross-contamination is the transfer of harmful bacteria or other microorganisms from one food item to another. It can happen through direct contact, such as using the same cutting board or utensils without proper cleaning, or through indirect contact, such as contaminated hands or surfaces.",
      "difficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 2,
      "question": "The danger zone for food refers to temperatures between 40°F and 140°F (4°C and 60°C), where bacteria can multiply rapidly.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "The danger zone for food is the temperature range between 40°F and 140°F (4°C and 60°C). Within this range, bacteria can multiply rapidly, increasing the risk of foodborne illness. It is important to keep perishable foods out of the danger zone to prevent bacterial growth.",
      "difficulty": "Easy"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 3,
      "question": "Washing hands with soap and water for at least 5 seconds is sufficient to remove harmful bacteria.",

        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "To effectively remove harmful bacteria, hands should be washed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. This ensures proper removal of dirt, debris, and microorganisms from the hands.",

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "explanation": "Foodborne illness symptoms usually appear within 24 hours after consuming contaminated food. However, in some cases, symptoms may take longer to develop or may occur more quickly, depending on the type of pathogen involved.",
      "difficulty": "Easy"
    },

      "questionNumber": 5,
      "question": "Thawing frozen food at room temperature is a safe method to prevent bacterial growth.",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Thawing frozen food at room temperature is not a safe method to prevent bacterial growth. It allows the food to remain in the danger zone for an extended period, providing an ideal environment for bacteria to multiply. The recommended methods for thawing food safely are in the refrigerator, under running water, or in the microwave using the defrost setting.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 6,

        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "To kill bacteria and reduce the risk of foodborne illness, leftover food should be reheated to a minimum internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). This temperature ensures that harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella and E. coli, are destroyed.",
      "difficulty": "Medium"
